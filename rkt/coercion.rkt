(define (exp x y) (apply-generic-coerce 'exp x y))

; The given implementation of apply-generic-coerce will enter an infinite loop
; when given two arguments of the same type but an operation that doesn't exist
; on that type. If the operation does exist on the type, it never tries to coerce.
; Therefore (exp 3 4) works fine, but
; (exp (complex rectangular 3 . 4) (complex rectangular 3 . 4)) loops.

; part b, page 271
; Louis is not correct that something had to be done about coercion with
; arguments of the same type. The existing procedure will look for a coercion
; procedure only after it can't find an operation for the given types.
; If it also can't find a coercion procedure from a type to itself, it will just exit with an error.
; It is only by adding a coercion procedure from a type to itself is a loop introduced.
