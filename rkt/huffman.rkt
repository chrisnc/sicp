; Exercise 2.71, page 228
; With alphabets where the weights are 1,2,4,...,2^{n-1}, the generated Huffman
; tree will always have a long left (or right) spine, because we always merge
; only one additional symbol (the one with the next largest weight).
; This will lead to only one bit being required to encode the most frequent
; symbol, and n - 1 bits needed to encode the least frequent.

; Exercise 2.72, page 229
; In the special case of frequencies given by 1,2,4,...,2^{n-1}, the
; number of steps needed to encode the most frequent symbol will be O(1).
; The root of the tree will have the left branch with just the most frequent
; symbol (since its weight outweights the others combined), and we emit a 0
; before even looking at the right branch.
; For the least frequent symbol, we will make n - 1 choices of which branch
; to take, and at each node the total number of elements in lists we inspect
; decreases by 1, starting with n. (We will look at the most frequent element's
; branch first, then the list of the remaining elements.)
; we will traverse lists with length decreasing by 1
; until we reach the leaf for the least frequent symbol. This has a runtime of
; (n - 1) * sum_{i=2}^n i \in O(n^2).
; If we implement the procedures such that in addition to always inspecting the
; left branch first, we assume that elements not represented in the left branch
; are contained in the right branch, (i.e., we assume that the caller has not
; given a symbol not present in the tree), then encoding the least frequent
; symbol can be done in O(n).
