--
-- part b
-- tree-to-list-1 uses append on the result of the left recursive call, so it
-- will use a quadratic number of steps in the size of the left subtree of the
-- root to convert the result to a list, because it does O(n) work in each
-- recursive call, and there are O(n) such calls.
-- tree-to-list-2 does only O(1) work in each recursive call, and there are O(n)
-- such calls, so tree-to-list-2 is O(n)

-- It first decides how many of the n elements to put into a left subtree, then
-- calls itself to produce this tree and the list of remaining elements. It
-- decides how many elements to put in the right subtree, as n minus the size of
-- the left subtree, minus 1 (for the root). It takes the first of the
-- non-left-elts for the root of the resulting partial tree, then calls itself
-- to produce the right subtree with the appropriate number of elements. It
-- returns both the tree formed from the root, left subtree, and right subtree,
-- as well as the remaining elements not consumed by the second recursive call.
--
-- part b
-- The work done in partial-tree excluding the recursive calls is O(1), and there
-- will be O(n) total calls to partial-tree altogether. Every call made with n >
-- 0 will consume a different element in the tree for its root, so there are n
-- such calls, and each call with n > 0 can make at most two calls with n = 0.
-- Therefore list-to-tree is O(n).
